# FreeL - reviewer

Starting the end of 2015 one of the biggest MOOC providers, Coursera, changed its policy regarding what features are available to non-paying learners. In many courses they now don't have access to graded assignments.

This project is intended to provide a platform for non-paying students to submit and review asignments. The process of submitting assignments for review and reviewing others' submissions is designed to mimick that of the specific courses at Coursera, so as to provide a learning experience close to that of the original.
